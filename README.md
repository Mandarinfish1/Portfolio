## Description

- My objective is to create a deployed portfolio of my projects, which will be available online for potential employers to review. The website I am building, utilizing HTML, CSS, and Flexbox, is designed to effectively showcase and organize the completed projects. In addition, developing this website presents an opportunity for me to apply and enhance the skills I have acquired from The University of Richmond Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.
